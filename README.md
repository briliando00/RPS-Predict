# Rock Paper Scissors Image Classification
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification of rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures. The model is trained using the Keras library and deployed as a web application using Flask.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of hand gestures representing rock, paper, and scissors. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.
